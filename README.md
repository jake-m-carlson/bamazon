# Bam-azon

This Node.js & MySQL application was built to simulate a virtual store. Once you run the app in terminal/ bash, it will tell you everything you need to know about the store.
* Products for sale
* Department 
* Price
* Quantity 
The app allows you to choose which item you want to buy, how many of that item, and the total cost. 

You're able to shop to your hearts content. Until you buy out the whole store. 

## Instructions
1. After installing the application and the necessary NPMs, type "node bamazonCustomer.js"
